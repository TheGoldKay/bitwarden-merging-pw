Obs-1 : After the clean up load the CSV file into a popular brower (Chrome or Firefox), one with no passwords saved,
after that download all passwords as CSV file (use the password manager of the browser)

Obs-2 : Recommend using a password manager such as Bitwarden to manage all passwords accross all devices, the first observation
was a way to make the Import of the clean CSV file usable since doing it manually or with Pandas the format isn't fully
supported by most passwords managers (tested with Bitwarden), that's why the CSV file must be imported and then downloaded 
afterwards to ensure proper compability due to specific syntax used by popular browsers
