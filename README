Obs-1 : After the clean up load the CSV file into a popular brower (Chrome or Firefox), one with no passwords save,
after that download all passwords as CSV file (use the password manager of the browser).

Obs-2 : Recommend using a password manager such as Bitwarden to manage all passwords accross as devices, the first observation
was a way to make the Import of the clean CSV file usable since doing it manually or with Pandas the format isn't fully
supported by most passwords manages (tested with Bitwarden), that's why the CSV file must be imported and then downloaded 
afterwards to ensure proper comability due to property syntax used by popular browsers
